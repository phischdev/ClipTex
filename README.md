# ClipTex
A comfortable mini IDE for Latex. The rendered image is always saved to the clipboard as a .png. Handy for using latex in chats.

The program is written in C# for use under Windows.
When you use it you want to open it by a keyboard shortcut, immediately write a few lines of latex code (by default in math mode), hit Ctrl-Enter and insert the picture that is already in the clipboard wherever you need it.</p>

It's all about speed and comfortability, providing use by shortcuts, autocomplete, placeholders in formulas between which you can jump and other clever IDE features.

My scenario is inserting formulas in the telegram desktop client.
